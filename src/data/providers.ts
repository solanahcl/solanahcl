#### Notes to consider for renting:

- DO NOT USE **OVH**. They may have the widest server availability but also the poorest understanding of Solana's network needs. You will randomly get blackholed and support is absolutely useless.
- DO NOT USE **hetzner**. They may shut you down without notice.
- Check reviews on the Solana Discord for your specific provider.
- Ensure you are not running within a virtual machine (VM).
- Verify the speed and uplink of the provider; low latency is crucial.
- Ask the provider about the hardware specifications, focusing on higher RAM frequencies.
- Before using your validator, confirm that all hardware components are functioning as expected.

#### Free to test for beginners

Some providers offer a test phase before you commit to renting with them, often as a playground to explore running a Solana node. You can check the list, which we update frequently with new providers.
