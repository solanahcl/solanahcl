export const storageNotes = `Drives are mainly recommended based on performance figures from the manufacturer. All tables are sorted by the claimed random write performance (IOPS), as this is an essential property for Solana validators.

Consumer drives are less suitable for Solana validators, because they are designed for lighter workloads and have lower write endurance compared to enterprise drives. Minimum 2 TB per drive is recommended. Larger drives offer increased write endurance, which is crucial for handling the intensive read/write operations of Solana validators.

**NOTE:** The Samsung 990 PRO has been reported to have severe endurance issues, and is therefore not recommended.`;
