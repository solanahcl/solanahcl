export const agaveNotes = `AMD is the CPU maker of choice when it comes to running Solana validators. Running Intel processors for a new validator is **strongly discouraged**. Intel Xeon Gold/Platinum (6[45]xx) are the only ones known to be able to possibly keep up with the chain.

**NOTE**: This list is not exhaustive, just a selection of CPUs different folks on the discord have run or are currently running. 
- 24 cores is the sweet spot for agave, as of 9/2025, frankendancer loves and utilizes more cores especially with revenue scheduler so 32/64 are more viable
- 12/16 cores will most likely struggle, and
- more than 32 cores will have a slower base clock speed due to TDP issues (32 cores would possibly be more future proof).

The recommendations also apply to RPC nodes, but RPC nodes require more cores and RAM than validators to perform sufficiently under load. RPC node operators should therefore aim for a slightly higher core count than validator operators.

* The CPU should be capable of at least 10M hashes/sec. Results based on governor set at performance mode.`;
